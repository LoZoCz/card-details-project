- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learned a lot about React, and I'll be using it more often than before, because I can see how this framework has helped me create a site more easily.

### Useful resources
